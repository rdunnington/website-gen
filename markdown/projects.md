#Projects
Like any programmer, I've had plenty of half-baked ideas in my spare time, but here are a few clean enough for public viewing.

##rjd
A lightweight cross-platform game engine written in C11.
This started as an experiment in how to do things without any of the object-oriented or RAII paradigms of C++, and I quickly fell in love with the simplicity and cognitive load of C. It's still in active development as I add more features to the library.
I'm bad at naming things, so I took a cue from the stb libraries.

##zig-slotmap
Zig is a great up-and-coming language with the potential to replace C. While writing a small asteroids game with it, I needed a handle-based, contiguous-memory data structure. I decided to publish a small standalone library that other people could use in their own projects.
The slotmap data structure has been around for a very long time in concept and implementation, but there hasn't been a common name until recently, where the name "Slotmap" seems to have won the popular vote.
