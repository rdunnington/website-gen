#Hello World
##2020-5-18

As of this writing, I’ve been working professionally in the game industry for nearly ten years. When I was a fresh college grad, I thought ten years signified a turning point. Once you’ve reached that milestone, you’re a “veteran.” Looking back, it seems humorously naive. There’s always more to learn, skills to sharpen, character to refine. There are many much more proficient than I who have plenty to say. So why add my voice to the noise?

I’ve read countless Stack Overflow answers, pored over technical blogs, and watched incredible talks, all for free. My development would never have come this far without the support of people I’ve never met giving away technical information, career guidance, and coding advice for free. It reminds me of something Jesus said:

	<p class="quote">Freely you have received; freely give.<br>- Matthew 10:8b</p>

In the same spirit, I’d like to give back. I hope that some of my words help someone else. Though I may be echoing many others, maybe these words will “click” in a way that hasn’t before. Either way, thanks for listening.
